#RPAutoparts
  RPAutoparts is a software tool that helps users research information from their competitors in the largest database in Europe, TecDoc. This tool is designed to simplify the process of searching for information related to OE codes or competitor numbers by automatically generating a list of brands related to the OE numbers.

  To use RPAutoparts, users need to have an excel spreadsheet that contains the OE codes or competitor numbers that they want to research. The software will then retrieve all the brands associated with the OE numbers and store the results in a new spreadsheet called 'results,' which will be automatically created once the code is finding new bases.

  It's important to have an excel spreadsheet named OEdataBase.xlsx in the same folder as the software to store the data to be researched.

#Future Updates
In the future, RPAutoparts will have more updates that will add more features to the software, including:

Getting all information about competitors
Selecting a competitor and getting all the vehicles
Selecting a competitor and getting their reference numbers
RPAutoparts aims to simplify the process of researching competitor information and make it easier for users to access and analyze data from the TecDoc database.
